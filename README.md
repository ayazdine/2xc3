**1-Introduction**

Files on a computer can primarily be classified into two types: ASCII (text) and Binary. Understanding the difference between these two types of files is essential for any budding programmer or IT professional.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): Represents text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices that use text. ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes, which support many more characters than did ASCII, have a historical basis in ASCII.

Binary Files: Contain data in a format that is not intended to be represented as text. It can hold any type of data and can be executable files, images, audio, and more.

**2-ASCII Files**

Overview: These are text-readable files and usually have the extensions .txt, .md, .csv, etc. You can open them with a simple text editor like Notepad or any IDE.

Example: An ASCII file can contain simple text such as: "Hello, World!"

Properties:

Human-readable.
Generally platform-independent.
Easier to debug and log.

**3-Binary Files**

Overview: Binary files are not designed to be human-readable. They can contain a mix of text and data, and usually have a broad range of file extensions based on the type and purpose of the file.

Examples: Image files (like .jpg, .png), audio files (like .mp3, .wav), and compiled software programs.

Properties:

Not typically human-readable.
It can be more efficient in terms of storage for certain types of data.
It may be platform-dependent.

**4-Practical Exercises**

To solidify your understanding of ASCII and Binary files, we've included practical exercises in this repository:

ASCII Exercise: Explore the given sample ASCII files and try to modify them using a text editor.
Binary Exercise: Analyze the given binary files. Attempt to open them with a text editor to understand the difference. Use dedicated software or tools to view or modify them.
